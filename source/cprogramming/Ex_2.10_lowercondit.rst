Exercise 2.10 - upper case letters to lower case
================================================

Question
========

Rewrite the function lower, which converts upper case letters to lower case, with a
conditional expression instead of if-else.

.. runcode:: ../../languages/cprogs/Ex_2.10_lowercondit.c

Explaination
============

In this program we are going to convert upper case letters to lower case.
We declare a function called lower in the beginning of the program.
When the program enters the while loop it each character it gets to lower::

	while((c=getchar())!=EOF)
    	{
        	putchar(lower(c));
    	}

The lower function checks for all the uppercase characters and prints everything in the lowercase. It does this by
a conditional statement, where if a upper case character is found, it subtracts 'A' to get relative index, adds it to 'a' to return corresponding smaller case character, if a lower case character is found, it is simply returned::

  return c>='A' && c<='Z'? c+'a'-'A':c;
