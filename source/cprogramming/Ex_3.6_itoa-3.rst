Exercise 3.6 - itoa with field width
====================================

Question
========

Write a version of itoa that accepts three arguments instead of two. The third argument is
a minimum field width; the converted number must be padded with blanks on the left if necessary to
make it wide enough.

.. literalinclude:: ../../languages/cprogs/Ex_3.6_itoa-3.c
   :language: c
   :tab-width: 4

.. runcode:: ../../languages/cprogs/Ex_3.6_itoa-3.c
   :language: c
   :codesite: ideone

Explaination
============

Note: For negative numbers the negative sign is written close to the number instead of before the padded width.
This is `itoa` conversion with padding. We specify the width of the number we want in `w` and as before, we proceed with `itoa`, wherein extract the unit digit (n `% 10`), convert it to character and store it in a character array.
If it were a negative number we store the sign too. We keep track of number of digits in the number in a variable, `i` and for the remaining digits, for `i < w`, we append the space character ` `.

We reverse the string thus constructed for our result.
