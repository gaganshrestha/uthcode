Exercise 3.2 - escape sequences into the real characters
========================================================

Question
========

Write a function escape(s,t) that converts characters like newline and tab into visible
escape sequences like \n and \t as it copies the string t to s. Use a switch. Write a function for the
other direction as well, converting escape sequences into the real characters.

Explaination
============

C Program interpreters `\n` and `\t` as space characters and outputs them. Our intention is to capture the `\n` and `\t` characters and display them visibly as **\n** or **\t**. In order to do that we need to *escape* them, the escaping is done by adding `\` character.

So in the program as soon as we see a `\n` character, in the array where we are copying to, we copy `\\` character and add a `n` character and similarly, when we see a `\t` character, in the array where we are copying to, we copy `\\` character and add a `t` character.
