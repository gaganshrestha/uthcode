==============================================================

Question
========

Write a function expand(s1,s2) that expands shorthand notations like a-z in the
string s1 into the equivalent complete list abc...xyz in s2. Allow for letters of either case and digits, and be prepared to handle cases like a-b-c and a-z0-9 and -a-z. Arrange that a leading or trailing -is taken literally.
