================================================

Question
========

Rewrite the function lower, which converts upper case letters to lower case, with a
conditional expression instead of if-else.

Explaination
============

In this program we are going to convert upper case letters to lower case.
We do this by
:: 
   while((c=getchar())!=EOF)
	  {
	  	putchar(lower(c));
	  }
Which means that when we enter a applet the program checks for the end of file and if the letters are in the upper case we convert them into lower case.
